# Project-Ghost-GitHub-Official
The official GitHub Page For what i currently call Project Ghost
So... I currently don't have much, i don't have a gamejolt page for it, Currently still Defining the itch.io, yeah... not much...
BUT. i AM working on a trailer, or at least, a teaser of what i currently have envisioned for the game...
If you ever for some strange reason need the .gmx file and the project folder, there is NO place more official(except my laptop) than the official GitHub Page!
Also, this might be useful for collaborating with others, not that i currently have plans on doing that...
NOTE: This README.md will DEFINITELY be updated as i make progress, and you'll be able to see it nowhere else as quick as on github,
Also maybe if i put a proper thank you for playing my demo, I could give people the ability to quickly play short parts of the game! Great for people who can't wait!
